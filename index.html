                    <h3>The Great Collapse</h3>
                    <p>Long ago, people had built great cities with towering walls that reached toward the heavens. These mighty settlements stretched across the lands, powered by ancient magic and old knowledge. But in their desire for more power, they destroyed the natural world, replacing green forests and peaceful meadows with cold stone and magical constructs.</p>
                    <p>The disaster began with what scholars called the "Unity Ritual" - powerful mages and alchemists wanted to create perfect beings by binding immortal essence into human flesh. They promised this great working would end death and suffering forever. But when they performed their grand ritual across all the kingdoms at once, something terrible went wrong.</p>
                    <p>Instead of creating paradise, the ritual tore nature itself apart. Dark magic poured out from deep places, twisting animals and plants into monsters, and poisoning the very air with corruption. Within days, the proud cities fell as their enchantments failed. Countless people died, and the few survivors watched their world transform into a place of darkness and fear.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="lore-chapter">
                    <h3>The Hundred Years of Darkness</h3>
                    <p>For a full century, the world stayed broken and dangerous. The few people who survived lived in underground shelters or hidden villages far from the ruins of their once-great cities. Fear kept them close to these safe places, as few dared to travel far into the cursed lands beyond.</p>
                    <p>During these long years, nature slowly began to return - but it wasn't the same as before. The dark magic from the disaster had changed everything. Dangerous creatures now roamed where peaceful animals once lived - slimes that dripped with corruption, walking skeletons driven by dark purpose, and goblins born from shadow and malice.</p>
                    <p>But hope survived, as it always does. In some blessed valleys, protected by tall mountains and flowing rivers, the land stayed pure and untouched by the curse. The surviving people called these safe places "Nevervales" - valleys that never fell to the corruption. Only in these beautiful places could anyone still see the world as it was meant to be.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="lore-chapter">
                    <h3>The Age of Renewal</h3>
                    <p>Now, a hundred years after the Great Collapse, the dark magic is finally starting to fade. The poisonous mists that once covered the land have lifted, and brave people are beginning to leave their hiding places to explore the world again. You are one of these bold pioneers, making your home in a newly discovered Nevervale - a beautiful valley of green meadows and clear streams, surrounded by lands that are slowly healing but still hold many dangers.</p>
                    <p>Your mission is not just to survive, but to help heal the broken world. Old stories speak of special crystals called "Harmony Stones" - pure gems blessed by nature itself that can cleanse corrupted land and drive away the monsters. If you can find and awaken these stones, the clean lands will slowly grow larger, encouraging other survivors to leave their refuges and help rebuild civilization once more.</p>

                    <p>Nevervale: The Last Haven is my passion project - a labor of love that I've been crafting story by story, system by system. As an indie developer, I'm pouring my heart into every aspect of this world, from the intricate farming mechanics to the atmospheric experience that will accompany your journey through the healing lands. I'm utilizing a combination of original programming, licensed assets, and AI-assisted artwork to bring this vision to life.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently deep in development, implementing the corrupted creatures with their unique behaviors, designing the mysterious Harmony Stones that will pulse with ancient power, and creating farming systems that feel both satisfying and meaningful to the world's recovery. I believe in transparency throughout this journey - I'll be sharing regular development updates, behind-the-scenes insights, and honest progress reports as the game takes shape.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-feature">
                        <h3>ðŸŒ± Land Healing System</h3>
                        <p>The most exciting part? I'm developing a unique "Land Healing" system where your actions literally transform the world around you. Watch as dead soil blooms with life, corrupted waters run clear again, and twisted creatures flee as the light of the Harmony Stones spreads across the valley.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I can't wait to share the secrets I'm hiding in the deepest corners of Nevervale - ancient ruins that hold clues to the Great Collapse, mysterious NPCs with their own tragic stories, and perhaps... ways to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again.</p>
